One of the most important applications of machine learning is Natural Language Processing. Here, we study the Large Movie Dataset V1.01. The goal is to predict the correct label for each review so that we can divide them into good and bad reviews.
Different machine learning algorithms have been studied along with the data manipulation techniques. Perceptron showed a promising performance on the dataset. It is mostly because the speech is not i.i.d random variable. Improvements over the perceptron algorithm i.e. average perceptron and ensemble of average perceptron further improved the performance of the classifier. The ensemble of the average perceptron showed a better performance on the evaluation set than XGBoost.
